Event, Team 1 ID, Team 2 ID, Season, Split, Games, Result
Note: Season + Split is used to determine what meta to draw from
For missing data, we compute the most relevant split (1 before, 1 after, 2 before, etc.)

1. Event/Season/Split propagation
1.1. REGION:
-> IsWR, -> IsKR, -> IsCN, ->IsEUW, ->IsNA, ->IsPCS, ->IsVN, ->IsJP, ->IsBR, ->IsLAT, ->IsMinorRegion

1.2. TIER:
-> EventTier, -> EventStage

1.3. META
-> EventGameTime
UTIL: META (TBD)

2. Team propagation (ORGS)
For each team... (prefix: T1[column], for example T1DPM)
-> DPM, -> FirstBlood, -> KillsPG, -> DeathsPG, -> AverageKDR, -> AverageAPK, -> Plates, -> Dragons, -> D15, -> Heralds, -> Nashors

3. Team propagation (PLAYERS)
For each player... (prefix: P1[column], for example P1DPM)
-> KDA, -> CSPM, -> GPM, -> GoldPercent, -> KP, -> DPM, -> DamagePercent, -> KAM, -> SoloKills, -> Pentakills
